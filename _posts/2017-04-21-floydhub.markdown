## Setup
- While looking for options to test deep learning training with GPU I came accross [FloydHub](http://www.floydhub.com), the Heroku for deep learning. It is easier to setup than AWS gpu instances.
- Install and get started [here](http://docs.floydhub.com/home/getting_started/)
```bash
mkdir PROJECT_DIR
cd PROJECT_DIR
floyd login
floyd init PROJECT_NAME

mkdir DATA_DIR
cd DATA_DIR
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/text-datasets/nietzsche.txt
floyd data init DATASET_NAME

floyd status
floyd data status
```

## Deep Learning Model

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from keras.utils.data_utils import get_file
from keras.utils import np_utils
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.layers import Dropout
from keras.layers import LSTM
from keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint
import sys
from keras import backend as K
print K.backend()
%matplotlib inline
```
